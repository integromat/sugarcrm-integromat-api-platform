# SugarmCRM Integromat API Platform

## How to register a custom platform

### Requirements
- SugarCRM v7.9+

### Installation
1. Login as Administrator into Sugar instance
2. Use Sugar's Module Loader to install the latest release zip from this repository

### Usage
SugarCRM will change its behavior out of the box to disallow unknown platforms in the Winter '18 (7.11) release. Therefore
any customizations or integrations which rely on a custom platform need to register those up
front.
